## My Papers

Here is a list of papers I have written as part of my studies or as a personal endeavor:

### 2025

#### Technical memorandum - Reforming the AOV in Suriname 
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
      This memo assesses the adequacy, sustainability, and reform potential of Suriname’s universal pension scheme (AOV). Using IMF macro-fiscal projections and a microsimulation based on the 2022 Survey of Living Conditions, it compares the current system to a reform scenario (“AOV+”) that raises benefit levels and introduces automatic indexation.
      
      Findings show that the reform could reduce elderly poverty by 45%, with costs remaining below 2.2% of GDP. A hybrid financing model — combining general taxation and oil royalties — ensures long-term sustainability. The proposed reform is realistic, pro-poor, and aligned with Suriname’s economic transition.

#### Essay on the Financing of Defined-Benefit Social Insurance
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
      This essay analyzes both the financing and the reform of defined-benefit (DB) social insurance schemes.
      The first part reviews the main financing approaches—Pay-As-You-Go, Scaled Premium, General Average Premium, and Fully Funded methods—highlighting their implications for sustainability, intergenerational equity, and coverage. It concludes that mixed approaches often ensure the best balance between adequacy and financial stability.
      The second part explores parametric reforms (e.g. retirement age, accrual rates, contribution ceilings) and systemic reforms, notably the shift toward Notional Defined-Contribution (NDC) models. These reforms aim to restore fiscal sustainability and fairness under demographic pressures but raise new challenges for benefit adequacy and social protection.

#### Student Poverty in France: Making the Case for a Universal, Unconditional Approach 
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
      Student poverty in France is a persistent yet under-addressed issue. Despite alarming indicators—such as widespread food aid use and poor housing—support policies remain mostly targeted, relying on means-tested grants based on parental income. However, this approach often fails to capture students’ real living conditions, particularly when family solidarity is lacking. This position paper argues that a universal, unconditional student income would offer a more effective and equitable solution. While targeted aid appears more cost-efficient in theory, it is often inadequate in practice and politically fragile. In contrast, universal coverage guarantees a baseline of dignity for all students, enhances academic success by reducing reliance on precarious work, and fosters stronger political support. Reassessing the cost and behavioral objections, this paper shows that universalism offers not only greater adequacy and administrative simplicity, but also long-term societal returns—making it the most appropriate path to fight student poverty in France.

#### Chatbots and Politics: Ideological Biases in AI? 
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
      Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok, influence political discourse due to biases embedded in their training data and the design choices made by developers. Using the PolitiScales tool, this study examines the ideological tendencies of various AI chatbots by subjecting them to a political test. The results indicate a general inclination toward a social-liberal, progressive, and internationalist stance, although differences emerge on the economic axis. These tendencies stem from the selected training corpora, supervised fine-tuning processes, and the potential influence of the entities developing these models. While such biases may help moderate extremist discourse, they also raise significant democratic and ethical concerns. Ensuring algorithmic transparency and AI independence is crucial to preventing hidden political influence in these emerging forms of automated information.

#### Impossible Dry January in France  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
      This paper examines the challenges of implementing all-groups/abstinence anti-alcohol public health campaigns in France, focusing on the "Dry January" initiative. Despite widespread alcohol consumption and its significant social and economic costs, French public health campaigns have primarily targeted specific groups and behaviors rather than promoting temporary abstinence for the entire population. The study highlights the role of the "Dry January Network," a coalition of third-sector organizations advocating for government-backed abstinence campaigns, and contrasts its efforts with the influential wine lobby, which defends alcohol as a cultural and economic cornerstone. Using stakeholder analysis and Kingdon’s Multiple Streams Framework, the paper explores why such campaigns stall at the policy decision-making stage, emphasizing political resistance, cultural identity, and lobbying power. While Dry January has gained public traction, its transition into a national public policy remains hindered by institutional and political barriers. The paper concludes with recommendations for better coordination, advocacy, and leveraging policy windows to advance public health initiatives.

#### From Nationalism to Jihad: The Islamization of Chechen Militant Groups  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
     This paper explores the transformation of Chechen militant groups from a nationalist to an Islamic nationalist orientation, focusing on the historical, social, and political factors driving this shift. Beginning with the secular Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1991, the movement gradually incorporated Islamic elements during the First Chechen War (1994-1996), fueled by foreign mujahideen and the ideological influence of Wahhabism. The Second Chechen War (1999-2000) further radicalized the struggle, as trauma, repression, and the decline of nationalist leadership paved the way for the rise of jihadist groups like the Caucasus Emirate. The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings exemplify the culmination of this Islamization, marked by the use of female suicide bombers and a shift from separatist to global jihadist objectives. The study highlights how socio-economic marginalization, war-related trauma, and external influences contributed to the radicalization process, ultimately transforming Chechen resistance into a transnational jihadist movement. This evolution underscores the complex interplay between nationalism, religion, and violence in post-Soviet conflicts.

#### The Economic Involvement of the Pasdaran in the Iranian Economy

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**: 
      The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has evolved from a military force safeguarding the Islamic Republic into a dominant economic actor in Iran. Initially integrated into economic reconstruction after the Iran-Iraq War, the IRGC expanded its reach through privatization and state-backed favoritism, creating vast conglomerates across multiple sectors. It controls major industries, engages in black market activities, and benefits from political connections to secure contracts and evade sanctions. While its economic presence supports Iran’s "Resistance Economy" and ensures regime loyalty, it also fosters monopolization, corruption, and inefficiency. This paper examines the IRGC’s economic footprint, its impact on Iran’s economy, and its role in sustaining the political system.

#### Syndicalisme Russe depuis 1990  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
      This paper examines the evolution of trade unionism in Russia since 1990, focusing on the failure to establish an autonomous and reformist labor movement. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, two key periods emerged: the early 1990s, marked by hopes for Western-style union reform, and 2006-2008, characterized by significant strikes and the rise of militant unions. Despite maintaining mass membership, Russian unions, particularly the FNPR (Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia), have increasingly aligned with political power, especially under Vladimir Putin’s regime. The study highlights the ideological shift from Soviet-era state-controlled unions to a more conciliatory, market-oriented approach in the 1990s, followed by the subordination of unions to the Kremlin in the 2000s. While alternative unions like the KTR (Confederation of Labour of Russia) have attempted to maintain independence, they face repression and limited influence. The paper concludes that Russian trade unionism has failed to achieve genuine autonomy, remaining largely subordinate to political authority and unable to effectively advocate for workers’ rights in a post-Soviet context.
