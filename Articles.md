#### Impossible Dry January in France

      **Abstract**:  
      This paper examines the challenges of implementing all-groups/abstinence anti-alcohol public health campaigns in France, focusing on the "Dry January" initiative. Despite widespread alcohol consumption and its significant social and economic costs, French public health campaigns have primarily targeted specific groups and behaviors rather than promoting temporary abstinence for the entire population. The study highlights the role of the "Dry January Network," a coalition of third-sector organizations advocating for government-backed abstinence campaigns, and contrasts its efforts with the influential wine lobby, which defends alcohol as a cultural and economic cornerstone. Using stakeholder analysis and Kingdon’s Multiple Streams Framework, the paper explores why such campaigns stall at the policy decision-making stage, emphasizing political resistance, cultural identity, and lobbying power. While Dry January has gained public traction, its transition into a national public policy remains hindered by institutional and political barriers. The paper concludes with recommendations for better coordination, advocacy, and leveraging policy windows to advance public health initiatives.

#### From Nationalism to Jihad: The Islamization of Chechen Militant Groups  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
     This paper explores the transformation of Chechen militant groups from a nationalist to an Islamic nationalist orientation, focusing on the historical, social, and political factors driving this shift. Beginning with the secular Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1991, the movement gradually incorporated Islamic elements during the First Chechen War (1994-1996), fueled by foreign mujahideen and the ideological influence of Wahhabism. The Second Chechen War (1999-2000) further radicalized the struggle, as trauma, repression, and the decline of nationalist leadership paved the way for the rise of jihadist groups like the Caucasus Emirate. The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings exemplify the culmination of this Islamization, marked by the use of female suicide bombers and a shift from separatist to global jihadist objectives. The study highlights how socio-economic marginalization, war-related trauma, and external influences contributed to the radicalization process, ultimately transforming Chechen resistance into a transnational jihadist movement. This evolution underscores the complex interplay between nationalism, religion, and violence in post-Soviet conflicts.

#### Syndicalisme Russe depuis 1990  
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      **Abstract**:  
      This paper examines the evolution of trade unionism in Russia since 1990, focusing on the failure to establish an autonomous and reformist labor movement. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, two key periods emerged: the early 1990s, marked by hopes for Western-style union reform, and 2006-2008, characterized by significant strikes and the rise of militant unions. Despite maintaining mass membership, Russian unions, particularly the FNPR (Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia), have increasingly aligned with political power, especially under Vladimir Putin’s regime. The study highlights the ideological shift from Soviet-era state-controlled unions to a more conciliatory, market-oriented approach in the 1990s, followed by the subordination of unions to the Kremlin in the 2000s. While alternative unions like the KTR (Confederation of Labour of Russia) have attempted to maintain independence, they face repression and limited influence. The paper concludes that Russian trade unionism has failed to achieve genuine autonomy, remaining largely subordinate to political authority and unable to effectively advocate for workers’ rights in a post-Soviet context.
