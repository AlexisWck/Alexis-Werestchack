## Curriculum Vitae

Graduate in International Security from Sciences Po and currently pursuing a Master’s in Public Policy and Human Development at UNU-MERIT and Maastricht University, with a specialization in Social Protection. I am passionate about the design, evaluation, and forward-looking analysis of social policies, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction and development. I bring strong quantitative skills (Stata, R, SQL, Excel) combined with hands-on experience in project management within the social and solidarity economy. My academic training in the social sciences, with a strong quantitative focus, is complemented by six years of volunteer engagement with Secours populaire français, strengthening both my analytical rigor and adaptability. I am committed to using these tools to support inclusive and evidence-based public policy design.
