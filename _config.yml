# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >-
  I am a Masterâ€™s student in Public Policy and Human Development at Maastricht University,
  with a keen interest in poverty reduction, labor market policies, and humanitarian aid,
  particularly in conflict zones. While my academic work focuses on understanding and
  addressing complex social and economic challenges, I also enjoy exploring the intersection
  of policy and technology. This GitHub repository serves as a space to showcase my coding
  projects, data analysis work, and any tools or resources I develop related to public policy
  research. Here, you'll find examples of my technical skills, including data visualization,
  statistical analysis, and programming applications tailored to policy-related issues.
  Feel free to explore my projects, collaborate, or reach out if you share similar interests!
