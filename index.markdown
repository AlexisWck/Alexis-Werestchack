My name is Alexis Werestchack.
Graduate in Public Policy and Human Development (specialization: Social Protection) from Maastricht University and UNU-MERIT, and in International Security from Sciences Po. I am passionate about the design, evaluation, and forward-looking analysis of social policies, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction and development.

I am currently Project Officer for International Solidarity with Secours populaire fran√ßais in Antananarivo, Madagascar, supporting local partners like Fifanampiana Malagasy (CSM-FIFA) to strengthen their organizational, strategic, and administrative capacities, monitor multi-sectoral development projects, and promote youth-led initiatives.

In parallel, I conduct applied research on social protection and development aid. I am developing an interactive tool to turn OECD CRS data into reproducible evidence on Social Protection, allowing custom classifications, visualizations, and comparisons across donors, recipients, and countries.

I also contribute to academic work on pragmatic leadership in international organizations (lessons from Francis Blanchard at the ILO) and the impact of external financial assistance on social protection spending in Egypt and Jordan.
