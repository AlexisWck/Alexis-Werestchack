My name is Alexis Werestchack, and I am a Master's student in Public Policy and Human Development at Maastricht University. This website is a space where I share my projects, papers, and a few blog notes.

### About my work
My current research focuses on evaluating an unconditional cash transfer program in a refugee camp in Kenya using a quasi-experimental statistical approach. In parallel, I am developing an interactive tool to compare public student aid schemes across Europe and working on a project exploring the relationship between income dynamics and far-right voting patterns.

I am also contributing to two academic article projects:
– one on pragmatic leadership in polarized times, drawing lessons from Francis Blanchard’s tenure at the International Labour Organization (ILO);
– another on how external financial assistance and technical advisory programmes influence social protection spending in Egypt and Jordan.

More broadly, I am interested in the design and financing of social protection systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Through my work, I aim to provide data-driven insights that support the development of fairer and more effective social policies worldwide.
