My name is Alexis Werestchack, and I am a Master's student in Public Policy and Human Development at Maastricht University. This website is a space where I share my projects, papers, and a few blog notes.

### About my work
My current research focuses on evaluating a cash transfer program in a refugee camp in Kenya using a quasi-experimental statistical approach. In parallel, I am developing an interactive tool to compare public student aid across Europe and working on a project that explores the relationship between income dynamics and far-right voting patterns.

Through my work, I aim to provide data-driven insights that contribute to more effective social policies.
